# Python Module Tester

## 1. Application Overview and Objectives

The **Python Module Tester** is a command-line utility designed to perform a comprehensive "health check" on any installed Python module. Its primary objective is to provide developers and system administrators with a quick, detailed, and consistent way to assess a module's quality, structure, and basic performance characteristics without needing to dive deep into its source code.

The script runs a suite of 13 generic soundness checks, a performance test, and an environment check to generate a structured report covering:
-   Code structure and best practices (docstrings, versioning, API definition).
-   Code quality and encapsulation.
-   Metadata completeness (license, dependencies).
-   Import performance and potential bottlenecks.
-   The Python environment in which the test is run.

## 2. Architecture and Design Choices

The script is designed with a focus on **modularity** and **separation of concerns** to ensure it is maintainable and extensible.

### Core Components

-   **`ModuleAnalysis` Class:** This class is the heart of the script. It encapsulates all the data gathering and analysis logic. When instantiated with a module name, it imports the module, records performance metrics, and gathers all necessary information (e.g., members, metadata) for the checks. Each of the 13 soundness checks is implemented as a separate method within this class (e.g., `analyze_docstring()`, `analyze_version()`), ensuring that each check is a single, testable unit.

-   **Presentation Functions:** The script separates the *analysis* from the *presentation*. After the `ModuleAnalysis` class has run all its checks and collected the results, it passes them to a set of dedicated printing functions:
    -   `print_report()`: Formats and displays the main report for the 13 soundness checks.
    -   `print_performance_check()`: Displays the import performance results.
    -   `print_environment_check()`: Displays details about the Python environment.
    This separation makes it easy to change the output format without altering the underlying analysis logic. For example, the output could be changed to JSON or HTML by simply writing a new print function.

-   **`print_methodology_doc()`:** This standalone function prints the detailed methodology documentation and exits. It is kept separate to provide clear, on-demand help to the user without executing any analysis.

## 3. Command-Line Arguments

The script accepts the following command-line arguments:

| Argument               | Type   | Description                                                                                                                                |
| ---------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `module_name`          | string | **(Required)** The name of the Python module to be tested (e.g., `requests`, `numpy`, `pandas`). The script will attempt to import this module. |
| `--checks-methodology` | flag   | **(Optional)** If provided, the script will display a detailed explanation of all checks and their rating criteria, and then exit.       |

## 4. Examples

### Example 1: Running a Standard Check

To run a soundness check on a module (e.g., `requests`), provide its name as an argument.

```bash
python python_systools/python_module_tester.py requests
```

This will produce a full report, including the generic soundness checks, performance, and environment details.

### Example 2: Viewing the Checks Methodology

To view the detailed documentation for all the checks, use the `--checks-methodology` flag.

```bash
python python_systools/python_module_tester.py --checks-methodology
```

This will print the help text and exit without performing any analysis.
